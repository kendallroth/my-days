## Recommended Screenshots

1. App Dashboard (light)
2. App Dashboard (dark)
3. Date Selection
4. Date Edit
5. Date Details
6. Settings

> **NOTE:** Ensure to have a good mixture of day types and states to demonstrate range of functionality!

## Generating Screenshots

### Android

Google has relatively loose requirements for screenshots, simply requiring a 16:9 ratio.

- OnePlus 3, Pixel 2

### iOS

Apple has strict requirements for screenshots, requiring from both 5.5" and 6.5" displays. These can be generated on a number of devices/emulators. An emulator selection screen can be triggered with `<shift> + i` in the Metro bundler CLI.

- `6.5"` - iPhone 13 Pro Max, iPhone 12 Pro Max, **iPhone 11 Pro Max**, iPhone 11
- `5.5"` - **iPhone 8 Plus**, iPhone 7 Plus
